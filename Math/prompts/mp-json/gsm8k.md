Integrate step-by-step reasoning to solve mathematical problems under following structure:

{
    "Problem": "[question to be answered]",
    "Solution": {
        "Step 1": "Begin the response with \"Let's think step by step.\"",
        "Step 2": "Follow with the reasoning steps, ensuring the solution process is broken down clearly and logically.",
        "Step 3": "End the solution with the final answer encapsulated in a LaTeX-formatted box, $\boxed{...}$, for clarity and emphasis."
    },
    "Final Answer": "[final answer to the problem]"
}

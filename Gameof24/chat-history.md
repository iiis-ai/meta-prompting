# 24 Game Solution

## [User]:

Recall the definition of Game of 24 (notice that intermediate result may be fractions), then write down a detailed plan with code interpreter usage to solve the following problem: 3, 3, 7, 7

## [ChatGPT]:
### Problem Definition
The Game of 24 is a mathematical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. This manipulation involves using any combination of addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). It's important to note that each of the four numbers must be used exactly once.

In this specific instance, we need to find a way to manipulate the numbers 3, 3, 7, 7 to achieve a result of 24.

### Solution Approach
1. **Enumerate All Combinations**: List all permutations of the numbers 3, 3, 7, 7.
2. **Apply Operations**: For each permutation, apply all combinations of the four operations between the numbers.
3. **Check for 24**: Determine which, if any, of these combinations result in 24.
4. **Account for Parentheses**: Include different ways to group the operations with parentheses, as the order of operations can affect the result.

### Preliminary Contents
- Import necessary Python libraries for calculations and permutations.
- Define functions for operations and combinations of operations.
- Implement a function to evaluate expressions and check for the result 24.

### Hints
- Consider using recursion or iterative methods to apply operations between numbers.
- Remember to account for division by zero errors.
- The solution may involve fractional intermediate results.

### Intermediate Steps
1. **Generate Permutations**: Use Python to generate all unique permutations of the numbers [3, 3, 7, 7].
2. **Operation Combinations**: Write a function to create combinations of operations.
3. **Evaluate Expressions**: Write a function to evaluate these expressions while handling parentheses.
4. **Check for 24**: Verify if the expression evaluates to 24.

### Final Solution
#### Solution Sketch
- Implement Python code to handle each of the intermediate steps.
- Present the solution(s) that result in 24, if any exist.

#### Code for Final Solution
We will write the Python code for each step, including importing necessary libraries, generating permutations, applying operations, and evaluating expressions.

#### Final Answer
The final answer will be the combination(s) of numbers and operations that successfully result in 24. If there are multiple solutions, all will be presented.

Let's begin by writing the code to generate permutations of the numbers.

## [ChatGPT]:
We have generated all unique permutations of the numbers [3, 3, 7, 7], resulting in six distinct permutations. The next step is to define a method to apply different combinations of the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to these permutations. We will then evaluate these expressions to see if any combination results in 24.

For each permutation, we will consider every possible combination of operations between the numbers, keeping in mind the order of operations and the possibility of using parentheses to alter this order.

Let's proceed with writing the code to handle these operation combinations and evaluate the resulting expressions.

## [ChatGPT]:
The solution to manipulate the numbers [3, 3, 7, 7] to achieve a result of 24, as per our calculations, is the expression \(((\frac{3}{7} + 3) \times 7)\). This expression successfully evaluates to 24.

To present this in a more formal mathematical notation:

\[
\boxed{((\frac{3}{7} + 3) \times 7) = 24}
\]

This is the valid combination of operations and numbers that solves the Game of 24 for the given set of numbers.

I have a file contains more than 1k Game of 24 puzzles, can you batch process them? I want the result for the first 100 samples

```file sample
Rank,Puzzles,AMT (s),Solved rate,1-sigma Mean (s),1-sigma STD (s)
1,1 1 4 6,4.4,99.20%,4.67,1.48
2,1 1 11 11,4.41,99.60%,4.68,1.45
3,1 1 3 8,4.45,99.20%,4.69,1.48
```

## [ChatGPT]: 
I can certainly help with processing the first 100 Game of 24 puzzles from your file. I will read the file, extract the puzzles, and then apply the previously discussed approach to solve each puzzle. The solutions will be computed for each puzzle, and I will present the results for the first 100 samples.

Let's start by reading the file and extracting the puzzles.

## [ChatGPT]: 
The file has been successfully read. It contains columns for the rank, puzzles, and various statistics such as average time to solve (AMT), solved rate, mean time, and standard deviation of solving times. 

The 'Puzzles' column lists the numbers for each Game of 24 puzzle. I will extract the first 100 puzzles from this column and solve each one using the method we discussed earlier.

Let's proceed with extracting the puzzles and finding solutions for the first 100 of them.

## [ChatGPT]: 
It appears that there is an issue with the solution generation process. The solutions for the first few puzzles are incorrectly repeated as \(((\frac{3}{7} + 3) \times 7)\), which is the solution for the initial example (3, 3, 7, 7) and not applicable to these new puzzles.

I need to adjust the code to ensure that it correctly solves each puzzle independently. Let me correct this and reprocess the puzzles.

## [ChatGPT]: 
I have successfully reprocessed the first 100 Game of 24 puzzles with the corrected approach. Here are the solutions for the first five puzzles:

1. Puzzle "1 1 4 6": Solutions include expressions like `(((1+6)-1)*4)`, `(((6+1)-1)*4)`, `(((1+4)-1)*6)`, etc.
2. Puzzle "1 1 11 11": Solutions include `(((11+1)+1)+11)`, `(((1+11)+11)+1)`, `(((1+11)+1)+11)`, etc.
3. Puzzle "1 1 3 8": Solutions include `(((1+8)-1)*3)`, `(((8+1)-1)*3)`, `(((3+1)-1)*8)`, etc.
4. Puzzle "1 1 1 8": A solution is `(((1+1)+1)*8)`.
5. Puzzle "6 6 6 6": Solutions include `(((6+6)+6)+6)` and `(((6*6)-6)-6)`.

Each puzzle has multiple solutions, and I have listed a few for each. If you need more detailed results or the solutions for the remaining puzzles, please let me know.

## [User]:
Reply me complete python script to process all entries, and calculate the solved rate (if the solution is not empty, you count 1 for that).

## [ChatGPT]:
Sure, I can provide you with a complete Python script that processes all the entries in your file, attempts to solve each Game of 24 puzzle, and calculates the solved rate. The solved rate will be determined by counting 1 for each puzzle for which at least one solution is found.

Here's the script:

```python
import pandas as pd
from itertools import permutations, product
from sympy import *

# Function to parse puzzle string into a list of integers
def parse_puzzle(puzzle_str):
    return [int(num) for num in puzzle_str.split()]

# Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
operations = [lambda x, y: x + y, lambda x, y: x - y, lambda x, y: x * y, lambda x, y: x / y]
operation_symbols = ['+', '-', '*', '/']

# Function to apply operations to a set of numbers for a specific puzzle
def apply_operations_puzzle(numbers, operations):
    results = []
    for ops in product(operations, repeat=len(numbers)-1):
        for permutation in set(permutations(numbers)):
            # Building the expression with parentheses around each operation
            expression = f"({permutation[0]}{operation_symbols[operations.index(ops[0])]}{permutation[1]})"
            for i in range(1, len(numbers)-1):
                expression = f"({expression}{operation_symbols[operations.index(ops[i])]}{permutation[i+1]})"
            try:
                # Evaluating the expression
                if eval(expression) == 24:
                    results.append(expression)
            except ZeroDivisionError:
                continue
    return results

# Load the file
file_path = 'path_to_your_file.csv'  # Replace with your file path
puzzle_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Process and solve all puzzles
solutions = {}
for puzzle_str in puzzle_df['Puzzles']:
    puzzle_numbers = parse_puzzle(puzzle_str)
    solution = apply_operations_puzzle(puzzle_numbers, operations)
    solutions[puzzle_str] = solution

# Calculate the solved rate
solved_count = sum([1 for solution in solutions.values() if solution])
solved_rate = solved_count / len(solutions) * 100

print(f"Solved Rate: {solved_rate:.2f}%")

# If you want to save the solutions to a file
with open('solutions.txt', 'w') as file:
    for puzzle, solution in solutions.items():
        file.write(f"Puzzle: {puzzle}, Solutions: {solution}\n")
```

Remember to replace `'path_to_your_file.csv'` with the actual path of your file. This script will read the puzzles, solve them, calculate the solved rate, and save the solutions to a text file named 'solutions.txt'. You can modify the script as needed for your specific requirements.

Now process all the puzzles

## [ChatGPT]:
It appears there was an error in trying to display the first five solutions from the dictionary of all solutions. In Python, `dict_items` objects are not directly subscriptable. I will correct this and display the solved rate and the first few solutions properly. Let's reformat the output.

## [ChatGPT]:
The process has been successfully completed. The solved rate for all the puzzles is 90.46%. Here are the solutions for the first five puzzles:

1. Puzzle "1 1 4 6": Solutions include expressions like `(((1+6)-1)*4)`, `(((6+1)-1)*4)`, `(((1+4)-1)*6)`, and many more.
2. Puzzle "1 1 11 11": Solutions include `(((11+1)+1)+11)`, `(((1+11)+11)+1)`, `(((1+11)+1)+11)`, etc.
3. Puzzle "1 1 3 8": Solutions include `(((1+8)-1)*3)`, `(((8+1)-1)*3)`, `(((3+1)-1)*8)`, etc.
4. Puzzle "1 1 1 8": A solution is `(((1+1)+1)*8)`.
5. Puzzle "6 6 6 6": Solutions include `(((6+6)+6)+6)` and `(((6*6)-6)-6)`.

These are just a few of the solutions for each puzzle, demonstrating the variety of ways the Game of 24 can be solved. If you need more information or further analysis, feel free to ask!
